##   **Introductionüìî**

</div>

Boundless Prover is a key component of the Boundless protocol, a decentralized, cross‚Äëchain marketplace for verifiable compute that leverages zero‚Äëknowledge (ZK) proofs. Provers are powerful GPU‚Äëequipped nodes that stake USDC, bid on compute requests via reverse‚ÄëDutch auctions, and generate ZK proofs‚Äîverifiable attestations showing a computation was performed correctly. Developers submit tasks and offer rewards, then provers compete to win the job, lock stake, and deliver the proof before the deadline. This mechanism‚ÄîProof of Verifiable Work‚Äîensures integrity and decentralization without requiring all nodes to re-execute code

##   **Benefitsüìà**

</div>

* Lots Of Knowledge

* Prover Incentives::: 0.5% Total Supply (5M ZKC) goes to Prover (May be more reward than that)üí≤


<div align="left">

##   **What Most Matters & Reward Calculationüß©**

</div>


* Total cycles generated by your prover

* Success rate of accepted proof jobs

* Speed measured by maximum effective HZ during proving

* **Scoring Formula:** `Score = Cycles √ó (Success Rate Multiplier) √ó (Max Effective HZ Multiplier)`

>Replace `Your_RPC_URL` with your actual Base Mainnet RPC Endpoint, within " "

* ####  Inject `.env.base` 

```
source .env.base
```

----To apply changes then You Have to run this command every time u start the prover 


## Configuring Prover & Broker

#### Single GPU Only:

* Here You will config `mem_limit:` & `cpus`  in the `compose.yml` file according to Your Resources (GPU, Ram & CPU)

```
nano compose.yml
```

1. Now GO to `x-exec-agent-common: &exec-agent-common` section and change:

1.1. `mem_limit:`        How much Ram u want to allocate, dont allocate max:

1.2. `cpus:`            Numbers of Core u want to allocation, u can allocate max if ur core are not doing big stuff: check core with `lscpu` 


2. Now scroll down and Go to `gpu_prove_agent0:` & change `mem_limit:` & `cpus:`  Here too: (See ScreenShot)

<img width="2892" height="820" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba890547-a294-405d-8638-4271151aa2c8" />



### 3. Configure Segment Size 

>Here we will change the Segment Size into the `x-exec-agent-common: &exec-agent-common` ...Check the below given Screenshot and edit the `Segment Size` according to your `VRAM` 

<img width="1132" height="336" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a25242c-8ae1-499a-a945-60fe2b94b3dd" />

* Now we will add Segment Size in the `.env.broker` 

* Firstly we will copy `.env.broker-template` into `.env.broker`

```
cp .env.broker-template .env.broker
```

* Open it and set `Segment Size` According to your `VRAM` : As same as above step:

```
nano .env.broker
```

* ####  Inject it into broker make changes:

```
source .env.broker
```

>You Have to inject everytime when you are going to run prover/broker

---


## Deposit & Stake Into Marketplace:

>here we will deposit some base mainnet `$USDC` into Boundless marketplcae for staking purpose: and for locking orders. No minimum but you can do around 1-2$:

1. Inject `.env.base` first:

```
source .env.base
```

2. Add boundless CLI into Path

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Deposit Usdc

```
boundless account deposit-stake STAKE_AMOUNT
```

4. Verify Stake

```
boundless account stake-balance
```


---

## Run Bento & Benchmarking Bento

 >Bento: `Bento is the local proving infrastructure. Bento will take requests, prove them and return the result.`

1. Here we will run bento & test it & benchmark our GPUs: 

```
just bento
```

* Make Sure your docker is running in Backgroud:

2. Check the logs

```
just bento logs
```

3. Now we will Run a test proof

```
RUST_LOG=info bento_cli -c 1048
```

>Now u have to check your GPU is utilizing well or now:

* Run `htop` in new terminal tab: and monitor it

* U can Increase `1048` to `2048/4096` if your gpu is not fully utilizing: 

* You should see `Job Done!` if everything work well:

<img width="1628" height="280" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f540601-f282-47e0-89c0-2ffc76e2f124" />


### Benchmarking Bento

>here we will Benchmark our bento to get to know about our `peak_prove_khz` , which we will use in the broker configuration:

What is `peak_prove_khz` ? --This should correspond to the maximum number of cycles per second (in kHz) your proving backend can operate -

* Inject `.env.base` first:

```
source .env.base
```

* Benchmark

```
boundless proving benchmark --request-ids {Order_ID}
```

* Replace `{Order_ID)` from the actual previous order id from official Dashboard: [Get_Order_Id](https://explorer.beboundless.xyz/orders)

>You have to use the `Fulfilled` and `Validated` order IDs: (check below Screenshot)

<img width="2184" height="301" alt="image_2025-07-19_18-40-01" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce2a7dd9-416d-4a39-b8f5-69385476c130" />



* Look at the below image, U can see `peak_prove_khz = 333` , the prover is estimated to handle ~333,000 cycles per second (~333 khz).

* We will use this in upcoming broker config file: 

* U can test many times to get the accurate of it:

<img width="2559" height="454" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-19 184051" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df3e91fa-e62d-4d9b-a792-8a7f2b781167" />

## Broker Configuration

>The Broker is a service that runs within the Bento proving stack. Responsible for market interactions including bidding on jobs, locking them, issuing job requests to the Bento proving cluster, and submitting proof fulfillments onchain


* Here You will download my updated `Broker.toml` file: But you all need to configure it manually according to your specs and resources: And u have to play with these configuration to make your broker `Competitive`:


1. Install `Broker.toml`

```
cd boundless
wget https://github.com/Mayankgg01/Boundless-Prover-Guide/blob/main/broker.toml -O broker.toml
```

2. Open `Broker.toml` 

```
nano broker.toml
```

>Now we will make Changes in it according to our system and resources: 

>‚ùóMention all the necessary configs which u have to change: Read all them very politely and change your config according to them:


### 1. `mcycle_price`:

* What it means:

   This sets how much you're charging per million cycles (mcycle) when bidding on proving jobs.  This is one of the inputs to decide the minimum price to accept for a request.

* Tip: Decreasing the `mcycle_price` would help your Broker to bid at lower prices for proofs. So Keep it low

* Ex. You can set it like or lower too: "0.000000000000001" 

### 2. `mcycle_price_stake_token`

* What it means:
     
     Defines which token you're pricing in (usdc) . This is used to determine the minimum price to accept an order when paid in staking tokens (usdc).

* Tip: You can reduce it or increse according to u: You can keep as well: `0.000001`

### 3. `priority_requestor_addresses`

* What it means:

     Priority requestor addresses that can bypass the mcycle limit and max input size limit. We alraedy set 4 official `priority_requestor_addresses` in our file:


### 4. `peak_prove_khz`

* What it means:

     This is your GPU's maximum proving speed, in thousands of cycles per second.

* How to set:

>You alraedy test it and got your `peak_prove_khz` here: [Benchmarking Bento](https://github.com/Mayankgg01/Boundless-Prover-Guide/edit/main/README.md#benchmarking-bento)

* Edit your `peak_prove_khz` in `broker.toml`

### 5. `max_mcycle_limit` 

* What it means:

     This limits the maximum job size (in mcycles) you‚Äôll accept. `(1 mcycle= 1 million cycles)` Avoids jobs that are too heavy for your hardware. Orders with cycles more than the set parameter will be spikked


* Tip: You have to change this according to your System: Prover with limited resources should reduce this number cause u cant complete this big order: So If your system or u have multiple gpu then set high: like 4000-5000

* 1 GPU users can set it like 1000-2000

### 6. `min_deadline` 

* What it means:

     This is a minimum number of blocks before the requested job expiration that Broker will attempt to lock a job.

>By setting the min deadline, your prover won't accept requests with a deadline less than that.

* How to set:

>Example: min_deadline = 300 means only take jobs that expire in >5 minutes.

>If your prover is fast and stable, you can reduce to 200 to get more jobs.

### 7. `max_concurrent_proofs`

* What it means:

    How many proving jobs your broker can run at the same time. When the numbers of running proving jobs reaches that limit, the system will pause and wait for them to get finished instead of locking more orders. 

* How to set:

>Set this based on your GPU + CPU power.

>Dont set it above 2 if you are on single GPU, If you're running multiple GPUs, you can increase this


### 8. lockin_priority_gas

* What it means:

     Minimum gas fee (in wei) to send priority lock-in txs. Increasing it to consume more gas to outrun other bidders

* How to set:

 >Example: `lockin_priority_gas` = 3000000000000 means 3000 Gwei. (0.000003 eth)

 >This is important for fast inclusion onchain.

 >Keep between 2000-4000 Gwei to stay competitive.

* Web to Calculate it: www.alchemy.com/gwei-calculator

## Stop the `bento`

>We will stop the `bento` to run the broker & applying config changes:

```
docker compose down
```

## Start The BrokerüöÄ

1. Inject `.env.base` 

```
source .env.base
```

2. Run Prover

```
just broker
```

>Running a broker with `just` will also start the `Bento` cluster through docker compose.

3. Check logs

>If u are doing in Local Pc then check your Docker Desktop that all 11 containers are running: 

>Check the `Broker` containers Logs:

* If cloud GPU then follow:

```
docker ps
```

* Broker Logs

```
just broker logs
